title: Autonomous Research Assistant (AutoRA)
description: Autonomous Research Assistant (AutoRA) is a framework for implementing machine learning tools which autonomously and iteratively generate 1) new theories to describe real-world data, and 2) experiments to invalidate those theories and seed a new cycle of theory-making. The experiments will be run online via crowd-sourcing platforms (MTurk, Prolific).
