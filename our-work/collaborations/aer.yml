description: The Autonomous Empirical Research Group (AER) strives to enhance and accelerate scientific discovery by automating each step of the empirical research process, from constructing a scientific hypothesis to conducting novel experiments. CCV's collaboration focuses on developing a framework which the group can use to run simulations to test machine learning models and run experiments with real participants.
