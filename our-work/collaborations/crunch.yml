description: The CRUNCH group is a research team of the Division of Applied Mathematics working at the interface of Computational Mathematics + Machine Learning + X, where X may be problems in biology, geophysics, soft matter, functional materials, physical chemistry, or fluid and solid mechanics. Their emphasis is on Scientific Machine Learning and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that the CRUNCH group pioneered.
