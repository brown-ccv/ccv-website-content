#   - service: "Google Drive"
#     description: |
#       Google Drive gives you unlimited space to store and share documents.
#       The native Google document formats allow for real-time collaboration and file history.
#       You can also store unconverted files of various types in your Google Drive.
#       It's easy to share files with members of the Brown community (including Google Groups)
#       and non-Brown Google accounts; files can be shared with view-only, comment, or edit access.
#       Google also has a really nice feature where you can scan in handwritten documents and have
#       them converted to text. You can access files on the web, through a mobile app, or by
#       installing Google Drive on your computer (which makes it act like a folder on your
#       computer).
#       - Best for: Collaboration in native Google files, easy access from anywhere, unlimited storage, sharing with Google Groups.
#       - Limitations: Data transfer speeds may be limited when uploading/downloading large amounts of data, Globus can provide high bandwidth data transfers.
#       - Rate: Free

#     description: |
#       RData is a high-performance data storage system which is accessible from any computer connected from Brown's campus network, or from outside the network via ssh.  It is backed up nightly on an incremental basis. What sets this option apart from the others is that it is directly connected to Brown’s primary supercomputer, “Oscar”, making computation easier. If you don’t intend to compute your data with Brown’s supercomputer, you may consider using Campus File Storage / Research instead. You could also use RData for computing and then move your results to Campus File Storage for greater accessibility, reliability, and protection.

#       - Synonyms: RDATA, GPFS, HPC Storage, Oscar Storage
#       - Best for: High performance storage of research data, perform computation on your data using Brown’s supercomputer
#       - Limitations: Not accessible on all campus networks.

# questions:
#   - question: What is the risk classification of your data?
#     information: |
#       Brown has classified its information assets into one of four risk-based categories
#       (No Risk, Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3) for the purpose of determining who is allowed
#       to access the information and what security precautions must be taken to protect it
#       against unauthorized access. It is the data and service owner’s responsibility to ensure
#       appropriate security measures are taken depending on the risk classification. If you
#       have any questions or need help, please reach out to the Information Security Group
