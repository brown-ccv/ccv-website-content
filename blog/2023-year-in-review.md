As we bid farewell to 2023, it's time to take a moment to reflect on the incredible journey of the past year.

- In June, Oscar transitioned from General Parallel File System (GPFS) to an all-flash parallel filesystem (**VAST data**) as its primary storage pool. And furthermore, it was done without any major issues. This is arguably the biggest change Oscar has gone through in the last 10 years!
- Over **470** questions were asked and helped in our weekly office hours
- Our team has been a part of over **60+ publications**
- In June, over **175** people registered for the bootcamp
- We hosted 17 Data Science, Computing, and Visualization Workshops (DSCoVs) with the Data Science Initiative (DSI). Topics included Gene Annotation Resources in R, ChatGPT's API and Prompt Engineering, Building VR Application in Unity, and more!
- Jupyterhub supported *8* courses undergraduate and graduate courses at Brown.

- We introduced our initial mobile applications: [**SOMA**](https://somatheapp.com/), an app focused on pain management, and [**MAPPS**](https://www.mappsproject.com/), an app designed to explore social interactions and their influence on disease transmission patterns.
- [**Honeycomb**](https://brown-ccv.github.io/honeycomb-docs/), a template for reproducible psychological tasks for clinic, laboratory, and home use has undergone a significant upgrade.
- [**Hierarchical Sequential Sampling Modeling (HSSM)**](https://lnccbrown.github.io/HSSM/) —a contemporary Python toolbox integrating cutting-edge likelihood approximation methods within the Python Bayesian ecosystem—was released on the Python Package Index (PyPI) in late June.
- We released two Julia Packages
- We developed and released a versatile utility script to streamline data exports to Oscar, led two XNAT Workshops for the neuroimaging community, and contributed to the MNE-BIDS open-source project. Furthermore, we enhanced the xnat2bids pipeline to accommodate EEG and Physiological data, highlighting our collective commitment to optimizing neuroimaging workflows and fostering open-source collaboration.

Thank you to our wonderful team! We held warm welcomes to **Anna Murphy**, **Prithvi Thakur**, **Galen Winsor**, and **Heather Yu**, the latest additions to our growing CCV team.
