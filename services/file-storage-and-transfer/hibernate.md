# Hibernate

Hibernate is a secure, reliable, research data archive solution. Hibernate is a Brown OIT archival service for the research community to migrate inactive data off active Network-attached storage (NAS) platforms onto a lower cost, long-term retention environment. 

* Hibernate leverages StarFish, an application that provides a metadata and rules-based management framework for large file systems. StarFish makes storage tiering easy: moving data, reporting, zones. 
* A zone is a virtual-volume or collection of branches across different file-systems (GPFS, Isilion, LRS etc.). Each PI group is distributed into an individual zone. A zone provides:
    * Types/sizes of files, access times
    * Hot Spots (Growth, user(s)/Group(s)
    * Action: Archive, Delete, Recover
