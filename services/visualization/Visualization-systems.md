## CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment 

We have experience developing 3D visualization software for large-scale mixed reality devices.
One of our projects involved VR Cave systems, which consist of an 8-foot cubic room where 3D images are projected onto three walls and the floor. The system utilizes [Volfoni](http://volfoni.com/en/edge-rf/) stereo depth-perception glasses, an [OptiTrack](https://optitrack.com) motion capture system, and positional audio delivered through a 5.1 surround sound system. These components work in sync to create the illusion of virtual reality in an open spaceâ€”without the need for head-mounted displays.
Software packages available through CCV include volume visualization, molecular visualization, and interactive 3D model manipulation, supporting research and education in various fields.

## Head Mounted Displays

Advancements from Oculus (Meta), HTC, and others have brought head-mounted VR displays (HMDs) into the mainstream. HMDs offer the most accessible way for individuals to experience virtual reality, and our goal is to support students and professors in exploring this technology.
We provide a small set of Oculus Quest 2 headsets, which are frequently loaned to professors for teaching. Additionally, we host ongoing events where attendees can explore VR games, art, and other media with our direct support.
Looking ahead, CCV aims to expand resources, support, and opportunities for Unity-based development with HMDs, further enriching the Brown community's engagement with virtual reality.
