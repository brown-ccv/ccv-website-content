Since its inception, **CCV** has been dedicated to supporting the academic community by developing interactive software designed to render and visualize datasets and models in **3D environments**. These environments can be displayed across a wide range of platforms, including:

- Monitors  
- VR headsets  
- Holographic displays  
- CAVE systems (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment)  

## Technologies We Use
To deliver high-quality solutions, we leverage the following technologies:

- **Unity 3D:** Creating immersive, real-time 3D applications  
- **WebXR:** Enabling cross-platform interactive experiences on the web  
- **Custom Engines:** Tailored engines for project-specific needs  

## Our Project Portfolio
Below we show a few of projects we have developed to enhance research, education, and exploration through interactive 3D visualization.

#### **[Draw On Air](https://ccv.brown.edu/our-work/software/cave-painting)** 
<p align="justify">
DrawOnAir is a haptic-aided input technique for drawing controlled 3D curves through space. It's implementation was later called Cave-Painitng and used as an artistic medium that uses a 3D analog of 2D brush strokes to create 3D works of art in a fully immersive Cave environment. It is used for scientific research in the virtual reality thearther YURT at Brown University. The Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV).CCV collaborated to implemet a modified version of the software that extends its capabilites to HMD(VR) devices such as Oculus Quest and Samsung Odessy on Windows platforms

#### **VR-Hearts**
<p align="justify">
A collaboration with the Biomedical Engineering Department at Brown University, this project enables students to visualize and analyze 3D models of hearts with various anomalies in real-time using VR.

#### **[Narragansett bay 3D viewer](https://ccv.brown.edu/our-work/software/vr-volume-viewer)**
The 3D volume of Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound below displays predictions from the Ocean State Oceanographic Model for salinity levels on July 15, 2018, at low tide.
This visualization supports transfer functions and animations, allowing users to explore salinity concentration at a specific date dynamically.

#### **Egyptology 3D*** 
A small VR visualization of the inscriptions found in the Pipi Pyramid in Egypt.
This project is a collaboration with the Egyptology Department to enhance classroom activities, allowing students to explore and analyze the inscriptions in an immersive way.
