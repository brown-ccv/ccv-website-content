title: Advancing Interactive 3D Visualization for the Academic Community
icon: virtual-reality
---

Since its inception, **CCV** has been dedicated to supporting the academic community by developing interactive software designed to render and visualize datasets and models in **3D environments**. These environments can be displayed across a wide range of platforms, including:

- Monitors  
- VR headsets  
- Holographic displays  
- CAVE systems (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment)  

## Technologies We Use
To deliver high-quality solutions, we leverage the following technologies:

- **Unity 3D:** Creating immersive, real-time 3D applications  
- **WebXR:** Enabling cross-platform interactive experiences on the web  
- **Custom Engines:** Tailored engines for project-specific needs  

## Our Project Portfolio
Below is a list of projects we have developed to enhance research, education, and exploration through interactive 3D visualization.

1. **Draw On Air** - *Collaboration with Daniel Keef, David Laidlaw to port this application to HMD*
