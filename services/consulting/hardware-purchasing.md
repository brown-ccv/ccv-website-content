CCV's High-Performance Computing (HPC) Architect and HPC Systems Engineers have many decades of combined experience building and maintaining supercomputing systems for scientific research. They also have excellent relationships with many hardware vendors. 

Are you preparing a grant proposal that involves a hardware purchase as part of a condo on Oscar? Or do you have an existing award, and you are considering a condo purchase? CCV is happy to help you determine what hardware would best satisfy your research computing needs. 

CCV can also help provide quotes from hardware vendors that you may include as part of a grant proposal's budget.
