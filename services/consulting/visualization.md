CCV's team of graphics software engineers provides a wide range of services to assist researchers at Brown with visualization projects, including:
 - Expertise with graphics software and packages
 - Familiarity with a wide range of cutting-edge visualization hardware
 - Custom software development  
 - Experience implementing advanced visualization technology in labs and work environments across campus

 Since its inception, **CCV** has been dedicated to supporting the academic community by developing interactive software designed to render and visualize datasets and models in **3D environments**. These environments can be displayed across a wide range of platforms, including:

- Monitors  
- VR headsets  
- Holographic displays  

## Software We Use
To deliver high-quality solutions, we leverage the following technologies:

- **Unity 3D:** Creating immersive, real-time 3D applications  
- **WebXR:** Enabling cross-platform interactive experiences on the web  
- **Custom Engines:** Tailored engines for project-specific needs
- **Paraview:**  3D visualization application designed for scientific data analysis and visualization (Also available in Oscar).

## Our Project Portfolio
Below we show a few of projects we have developed to enhance research, education, and exploration through interactive 3D visualization.

#### **[Draw On Air](https://ccv.brown.edu/our-work/software/cave-painting)** 
<p align="justify">
DrawOnAir is a haptic-aided input technique for drawing controlled 3D curves through space. Its implementation was later called Cave-Painting and used as an artistic medium that uses a 3D analog of 2D brush strokes to create 3D works of art in a fully immersive Cave environment. It is used for scientific research in the virtual reality theater YURT at Brown University. The Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV). CCV collaborated to implement a modified version of the software that extends its capabilities to HMD(VR) devices such as Oculus Quest and Samsung Odyssey on Windows platforms

#### **VR-Hearts**
<p align="justify">
A collaboration with the Biomedical Engineering Department at Brown University. This project enables students to visualize and analyze 3D models of hearts with various anomalies in real-time using VR.

#### **[Narragansett bay 3D viewer](https://ccv.brown.edu/our-work/software/vr-volume-viewer)**
The 3D volume of Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound below displays predictions from the Ocean State Oceanographic Model for salinity levels on July 15, 2018, at low tide.
This visualization supports transfer functions and animations which allow users to explore salinity concentration at a specific date dynamically.

We have a fully interactive version of this application tailored for the Rhode Island Data and Discovery Center website. Follow this [link](https://bay-viewer.riddc.brown.edu/) and play with it.

#### **Egyptology 3D** 
A VR visualization of the inscriptions found in the Pipi Pyramid in Egypt.
This project is a collaboration with the Egyptology Department to enhance classroom activities, allowing students to explore and analyze the inscriptions in an immersive way.

## Legacy Visualization Systems
Previously, CCV was responsible for maintaining and developing software for large-scale mixed reality devices. One of our projects involved the CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) VR system, which consists of multiple large projection screens or walls that surround the user with high-resolution 3D visuals.

Unlike traditional VR headsets, a CAVE provides a fully immersive experience without requiring bulky hardware. Users can explore 3D visualizations naturally, making it ideal for scientific research, data analysis, and virtual prototyping.

Examples of such systems included the CAVE located in the Granoff Building and the large-scale virtual reality theater [YURT](https://news.brown.edu/articles/2015/12/yurt).

### ðŸš¨ Disclaimer
While we have experience working with CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) systems and have developed software for them, we no longer support these installations, and they are no longer available for use. The previous CAVE systems have been dismantled and are out of service.
