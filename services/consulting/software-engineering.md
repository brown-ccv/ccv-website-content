CCV's research software engineers work with researchers to develop scientific software that is essential to conduct their research. This includes, for example, the development of tools and libraries for working with data, building workflows and infrastructure, and web application development. Our team of research software engineers also work with researchers to help take existing software and optimize it for performance and efficiency.

We have expertise in `C`, `C++`, `CUDA`, `Fortran`, `JavaScript`, `Julia`, `Matlab`, `OpenCL`, `Python`, `R`, and `SQL`. To achieve best practices in reproducible research, we use state-of-the-art technologies like [Docker](https://docker.com), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com), [Conda](https://conda.io), among others.
