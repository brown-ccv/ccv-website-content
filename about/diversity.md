title: Diversity Statement
---

CCV embraces a community enriched and enhanced by diverse dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, disability status, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class and religion. We believe diversity brings innovation and progress. We are especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations that have been historically underrepresented in STEM.

We are committed to attracting, recruiting and retaining a diverse team. We especially encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to join our community.
