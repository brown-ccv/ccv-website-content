### Computational Biology Core
Leadership: [Ashok Ragavendran](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/60802d0b-8f18-499a-a1f3-5f9b24c390e4)
>The COBRE-CBHD Computational Biology Core (CBC) integrates across multiple research focused Centers supporting data-intensive research using high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing datasets. CBC provides help for experimental design and data processing pipelines for high-throughput datasets generated in individual projects, particularly for DNA/RNA sequencing data.

### Graphics, Software, and Data Core
Leadership: [Isabel Restrepo](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/cb8b0a49-ef4b-66e7-5ccc-6689493e8ace), [Bradford Roarr](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/0adf6ab4-8d56-410a-8ac6-4b4ca136a534)
>We partner with Brownâ€™s academic researchers and administrators to bring modern software engineering, visualization, and data science practices to their work. We are software engineers and data scientists with expertise in a broad range of fields, including: visualization techniques, computer vision, computer graphics, web technologies, data management, and data science. We can program in almost any language, and enjoy learning new technologies, documenting, striving for best practices, and especially brewing coffee. Additionally, our group is responsible for supporting and developing Virtual Reality applications, we maintain the CAVE and collaborate with the [Multimedia Labs at Brown](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/multimedia-labs-new-site/home) to bring VR to the community. 

### High-Performance Computing
Leadership: [Ashok Ragavendran](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/60802d0b-8f18-499a-a1f3-5f9b24c390e4)
>Our software engineers help researchers to get the most out of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. To achieve this, we partner with users to design, debug, and optimize their code to run in an HPC environment. We also collaborate with new and non-traditional HPC users to help them to scale up and accelerate their science.

### High-Performance Computing Systems
Leadership: [Paul Koussa](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/c67a6c91-53f3-3502-8fcb-006770f4d76e), [Sam Fulcomer](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/0d83d4b5-85a5-62fc-44a3-81eaff49e183)
>Our HPC architects and systems engineers are responsible for building and maintaining the hardware and system-level software for Brown's primary supercomputer, "Oscar". This includes designing the overall architecture of the system, the storage and networking configurations, as well as the operating system and the system libraries. Our HPC architects and engineers also work with researchers to plan hardware purchases for grant applications; in some cases this includes partnering with researchers to write portions of grant applications. 

### Research Technical Services
Leadership: [Yang Liu](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/e0e55df3-9f2c-4a12-a1de-742955164e1e)
>Our team of research computing consultants support researchers across all of our research computing environments and tools. This includes Oscar, Stronghold, Globus, Hibernate, JupyterHub, and others. We can help with onboarding to our systems, debugging, and deciding what systems are best suited to your research computing needs. We hold regular weekly office hours, and are happy to help with tutorials and additional consultation sessions outside of office hours.
