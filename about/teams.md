### Computational Biology Core
Leadership: [Ashok Ragavendran](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/60802d0b-8f18-499a-a1f3-5f9b24c390e4)
>The COBRE-CBHD Computational Biology Core (CBC) integrates across multiple research focused Centers supporting data-intensive research using high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing datasets. CBC provides help for experimental design and data processing pipelines for high-throughput datasets generated in individual projects, particularly for DNA/RNA sequencing data.

### High-Performance Computing
Leadership: [Ashok Ragavendran](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/60802d0b-8f18-499a-a1f3-5f9b24c390e4)
>Our software engineers help researchers to get the most out of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. To achieve this, we partner with users to design, debug, and optimize their code to run in an HPC environment. We also collaborate with new and non-traditional HPC users to help them to scale up and accelerate their science.

### GSDC (Graphics, Software and Data Core)
Leadership: [Isabel Restrepo](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/cb8b0a49-ef4b-66e7-5ccc-6689493e8ace), [Mary McGrath](https://directory.brown.edu/uuid/fa814738-23c5-42b9-a63c-1ea789f3d1eb)
>We partner with Brownâ€™s academic researchers and administrators to bring modern software engineering, visualization, and data science practices to their work. We are software engineers and data scientists with expertise in a broad range of fields, including: visualization techniques, computer vision, computer graphics, web technologies, data management, and data science. We can program in almost any language, and enjoy learning new technologies, documenting, striving for best practices, and especially brewing coffee. Additionally, our group is responsible for supporting and developing Virtual Reality applications, we maintain the CAVE and collaborate with the [Multimedia Labs at Brown](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/multimedia-labs-new-site/home) to bring VR to the community.
