        We are inviting faculty to contribute to the roadmap for Brown's research technology and services. OIT leadership and our IT strategic planning consultants will be holding feedback sessions in May and June to understand where and how faculty would like to see technology infrastructure capabilities and research consulting services expand and improve.

        These sessions will cover topics of concern including technology needs associated with:

        * enabling computationally and data intensive research,
        * facilitating external collaborations,
        * supporting research data management needs,
        * accessing research software and support,
        * supporting near term grant opportunities, and
        * securing and protecting the availability of research data.

        Virtual Sessions are planned for May 23, June 6, and June 7. Please register with our signup form here: https://forms.gle/iXMrprsbDPuYs79u8
