services:
  - name: "Google Drive"
    description: |
      Google Drive gives you unlimited space to store and share documents.
      The native Google document formats allow for real-time collaboration and file history.
      You can also store unconverted files of various types in your Google Drive.
      It's easy to share files with members of the Brown community (including Google Groups)
      and non-Brown Google accounts; files can be shared with view-only, comment, or edit access.
      Google also has a really nice feature where you can scan in handwritten documents and have
      them converted to text. You can access files on the web, through a mobile app, or by
      installing Google Drive on your computer (which makes it act like a folder on your
      computer).
      - Best for: Collaboration in native Google files, easy access from anywhere, unlimited storage, sharing with Google Groups.
      - Limitations: Data transfer speeds may be limited when uploading/downloading large amounts of data, Globus can provide high bandwidth data transfers.
      - Rate: Free

      RData is a high-performance data storage system which is accessible from any computer connected from Brown's campus network, or from outside the network via ssh.  It is backed up nightly on an incremental basis. What sets this option apart from the others is that it is directly connected to Brown’s primary supercomputer, “Oscar”, making computation easier. If you don’t intend to compute your data with Brown’s supercomputer, you may consider using Campus File Storage / Research instead. You could also use RData for computing and then move your results to Campus File Storage for greater accessibility, reliability, and protection.

      - Synonyms: RDATA, GPFS, HPC Storage, Oscar Storage
      - Best for: High performance storage of research data, perform computation on your data using Brown’s supercomputer
      - Limitations: Not accessible on all campus networks.

questions:
  - question: What is the risk classification of your data?
    information: |
      Brown has classified its information assets into one of four risk-based categories
      (No Risk, Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3) for the purpose of determining who is allowed
      to access the information and what security precautions must be taken to protect it
      against unauthorized access. It is the data and service owner’s responsibility to ensure
      appropriate security measures are taken depending on the risk classification. If you
      have any questions or need help, please reach out to the Information Security Group
      (isg@brown.edu). [Brown Data Risk Classification](https://it.brown.edu/computing-policies/risk-classifications)

  - question: Would you like a DOI auto-generated for your data?
    information: |
      A digital object identifier (DOI) is unique and persistent identifier used to identify 
      a physical, digital, or abstract object (e.g., journal article, research report, or data
      set). The DOI remains constant over the life of the object, and as such, provides a
      digital, searchable, and persistent link. The Brown University Library will help students, 
      faculty, and staff obtain a DOI for digital assets produced via the scholarly, 
      instructional, research, and administrative activities at Brown. [You can learn more

  - question: Do you need snapshots or replication of your data?
    information: |
      Many storage services offer the ability to take "snapshots" or backup copies of your 
      data. As the terms suggests, these amount to duplicate copies—frozen at a given point
      in time—of your data. And if necessary, your data could be restored to a prior snapshot
      or replication copy of the data.

          - False
  - question: How much data do you have?
    information: |
      Most of the storage services the University offers can accommodate very large data 
      sets. But there are fewer options once your data grows to exceptionally large sized. 
      And for the exceptionally large data sets, these will also often exceed the free 
      allocations that Brown provides—and thus, you might need to pay a small fee for 
      the additional storage.
